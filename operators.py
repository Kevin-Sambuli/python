#     * multiplication
#     / division
#     ** exponential
#      % modulo operator - returns the remainder of a division

print(49//2)

# Assignment operators
#  all comparison operators normally produce boolean
    #  = assigns to an identifier

# logical operators and or
#   and
        #  compare two conditions
        # it will evaluate to False and True
